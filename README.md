## Overview

This repository contains scripts used to explore the biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the context of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, including:

1. **Love-Q relation**: connecting spin-induced quadrupole moment and tidal deformability.  
2. **Fundamental mode frequency relation**: connecting f-mode frequency and tidal deformability.  
3. **Binary-Love relation**: connecting the tidal deformabilities of binary components.
